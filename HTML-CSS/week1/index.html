     <h2>About me</h2>
     <p class="about-me-p">
     I am the son of Zeus, but there was a time when i proved reckless to the point of disobeying orders by Zeus not to wage war. My penance was to live as a disabled mortal, deprived of my godly powers and even the memory of having been a god
     Instead, those powers were transferred into my hammer and an enchantment was cast on it to govern what would happen should i ever find the hammer's hiding place, and also to disguise it as an ordinary walking stick. It was then hidden in a cave.
     Part of the enchantment meant that once i had earned that penance and was worthy to wield Mjolnir again, i would find it. There is an inscription on its head that says "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor".
