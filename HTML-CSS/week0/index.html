     <p class="justify text-margin">It was theorised decades ago but never seen. Now it seems the sterile neutrino could fix flaws in fundamental physics – if only we could find it.This is the story of a particle that has refused to die. For 50 years, it has haunted particle physics, with hints of its presence appearing in maddeningly ambiguous ways. Some believe they have seen it. Others think it is a figment of our imagination. But every time we think it is definitely not there, a sudden gust of wind knocks over the furniture and once more there is room for doubt.

Elusive though it is, the sterile neutrino would be a real boon. It could make sense of experimental anomalies stretching back decades, and give us the first confirmed glimpse of physics beyond what we know. It could even explain the strangely low masses of the ordinary neutrinos, as well as offering a convincing candidate for dark matter.

The bad news is that the latest round of experiments set up to look for it claim that it can’t possibly be there. Some physicists think that’s the end of the story. Others still believe in a mystery particle, but conclude it is nothing like we imagined. However, for some, a combination of experimental uncertainties and flawed analyses means that maybe – just maybe – the sterile neutrino could be alive and kicking after all. The problem starts with the neutrino bit. Neutrinos are notoriously hard to pin down. They have no charge, almost no mass and can pass through matter by the millions without leaving a trace.

The first inkling we had that they were out there came in 1930, when physicist Wolfgang Pauli …<br>By <strong>Abigail Beall</strong>     </p>

    <span class="strong">Revealing hidden information in sound waves</span><br>
   </p> 
   <p class="justify text-margin">By essentially turning down the pitch of sound waves, University of Michigan engineering researchers have devised a way to unlock greater amounts of data from acoustic fields than ever before.

That additional information could boost performance of passive sonar and echolocation systems for detecting and tracking adversaries in the ocean, medical imaging devices, seismic surveying systems for locating oil and mineral deposits, and possibly radar systems as well.

"Acoustic fields are unexpectedly richer in information than is typically thought," said David Dowling, a professor in U-M's Department of Mechanical Engineering.

He likens his approach to solving the problem of human sensory overload.



"The techniques my students and I have developed will allow just about any signal to be shifted to a frequency range where you're no longer confused," said Dowling, whose research is primarily funded by the U.S. Navy.

Navy sonar arrays on submarines and surface ships deal with a similar kind of confusion as they search for vessels on the ocean surface and below the waves. The ability to detect and locate enemy ships at sea is a crucial task for naval vessels.

Sonar arrays are typically designed to record sounds in specific frequency ranges. Sounds with frequencies higher than an array's intended range may confuse the system; it might be able to detect the presence of an important contact but still be unable to locate it.

Any time sound is recorded, a microphone takes the role of the human ear, sensing sound amplitude as it in varies in time. Through a mathematical calculation known as a Fourier transform, sound amplitude versus time can be converted to sound amplitude versus frequency.

With the recorded sound translated into frequencies, Dowling puts his technique to use. He mathematically combines any two frequencies within the signal's recorded frequency range, to reveal information outside that range at a new, third frequency that is the sum or difference of the two input frequencies.


In the case of a Navy vessel's sonar array, that additional information could allow an adversary's ship or underwater asset to be reliably located from farther away or with recording equipment that was not designed to receive the recorded signal. In particular, tracking the distance and depth of an adversary from hundreds of miles away—far beyond the horizon—might be possible.


"The science that goes into biomedical ultrasound and the science that goes into Navy sonar are nearly identical," Dowling said. "The waves that I study are scalar, or longitudinal, waves. Electromagnetic waves are transverse, but those follow similar equations. Also, seismic waves can be both transverse and longitudinal, but again they follow similar equations.

"There's a lot of potential scientific common ground, and room to expand these ideas."

The study is published in the current edition of Physical Review Fluids.

    <span class="strong">Spotting nature's own evolution of quantum tricks could transform quantum technology
     </span><br>
     
   </p> 
   <p class="justify text-margin"> A new test to spot where the ability to exploit the power of quantum mechanics has evolved in nature has been developed by physicists at the University of Warwick.

The test identifies a tell-tale hallmark of quantum coherence, classifying the properties of particles in a quantum state that are interacting with a real-world environment. The test should allow scientists to quantify and track quantum coherence in the natural world using laboratory experiments.

 The theoretical work could lead to experiments that help solve the debate on whether biological processes exploit quantum mechanics to their advantage, and whether evolution could provide us with a template for quantum technologies such as computers, sensors and energy sources.
  The test identifies a tell-tale hallmark of quantum coherence, classifying the properties of particles in a quantum state that are interacting with a real-world environment.

The effect underpins technologies such as quantum computers, quantum sensors and quantum communication systems, which use ordered systems isolated from the rest of the world. However, whether quantum coherence exists in the noisier and messier real world is more difficult to identify.


Dr. George Knee, 1851 Royal Commission Research Fellow from the University's Department of Physics, said: "To demonstrate the presence of quantum coherence in a biological system would constitute a paradigm shift, away from the idea that only humans have the ability to engineer systems capable of exhibiting and exploiting quantum coherence. It would also be a step toward the Schroedinger's Cat thought experiment, where a living organism is placed in a state where it is, quantum coherently, both dead and alive."

Co-author Dr. Animesh Datta said: "The results from this test will be valuable in improving our understanding of how chemistry and biology works, and may allow us to answer the question of whether quantum physics has played a part in evolutionary processes."

Dr. Knee added: "The possibilities are tantalising: if our proposed test were carried out in a biological system, and returned a positive result, we might be able to learn quantum engineering design principles from nature<span id="games">.</span> We could then try to create biomimetic technologies that are more robust and perhaps even more powerful than the current generation of quantum technologies, which are almost exclusively based on highly isolated systems. If we were able to turbocharge artificial light harvesting, such as in a solar cell for example, there would be a huge potential for proviWith a ding affordable, renewable energy."
